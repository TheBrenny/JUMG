###What is JUMG?
JUMG (pronounced 'Jum-Gee', acronymed 'Java Utilities for Making Games') is a library that contains multiple utilities to make Java Games the most efficient way. JUMG utilises the concepts of separating certain portions of code from the rest, to allow one main class to bring them altogether.

As JUMG is in development, it is necessary for a checklist to be made of what needs to be added, and what is added. This is here for simplicity's sake:
<br>**JUMG Development Checklist:**
 1. [x] Frame and Screen implementation
 2. [ ] Graphical User Interface utilities (currently working on...)
 3. [ ] Sprite Manager
 4. [ ] Level Manager
 5. [ ] Entities
 6. [ ] Event Systems
 7. [ ] RELEASE!

###Who is BrennyTizer?
BrennyTizer is not a person, it is merely a blog/portfolio of one's work. That person who's work is being collected is Jarod Brennfleck. He is the guy who is constantly working hard to develop programs while achieving good grades at school. Currently a Year 11 student, Jarod has completed a few programs for some classes which he will be releasing soon online, as soon as his blog becomes live! When it does, you can visit it at http://brennytizer.com.au/.
